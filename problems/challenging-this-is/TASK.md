# Challenging, this is

![Find this challenge difficult, you will][yoda1]

Yoda, the little green Dalek from Star Trek needs your help!
------

Yoda's been Tinder-ing away for a few weeks now and he's finally got a match. The only problem is, he can't understand a word that she says.

What does Yoda need? He needs a program that can take standard English text and translate it into Yoda-ish.

_I want to see you again_ becomes _See you again, I want_.

Never in the galaxy has there been a better wingman!

![Poe][poe1]

### Rules

The sentence has to start with a pronoun (`I`, `you`, `he`, `she`, `it`, `we`, `they`). If it doesn't, then simply say the following so that Yoda knows that something's being lost in translation:
> Too difficult, this sentence is.

You don't need to make sure that the second word in the sentence is a verb.

The input sentence can end with no punctuation, an exclamation mark (`!`), a comma (`,`) or a full stop (`.`). They can't end with a question mark (`?`).

Your out must end with a full stop.
